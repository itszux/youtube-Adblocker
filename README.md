Youtube adblocker that work after the recent updates of youtube which detect adblockers and block the player

Its mechanism is simple which get the embed video link of the current playing video and displays it in iframe in the player

How to inject the code into youtube:

>
> 2- Press on the extension button
>

> 
> 5- Then add the js and css codes
> 
> 6- Click save and go try it
